 <h1>Angels of Anguish POV lore part 1:</h1>
  <p>Lord Brutaxias lumbered onwards. The heavy footfalls of his boots ground the ashen wastes into a fine powder. Behind him daemon engines marched, and his legionaries shackled up another group of human slaves to be taken away and converted into frothing cultists of the ruinous powers.</p>

  <p>Up ahead, his newest ally was kneeling in the dust. Before him in the sand was the corpse of a nameless human, its entrails spilt out on the sands and spelled into some kind of communique only the twisted mind of Tzeentch could comprehend.</p>

  <p>Standing around the sorcerer were five of Brutaxias’ most seasoned and expert warriors. All had served in the heresy, and he trusted nothing in his warband as he might trust them. Veterans of the company he once commanded, Apollyon company. They were under orders to protect the sorcerer, but also to execute him should he begin to act out of line. All were traitors here, but this one more than most. A pariah of The Sons of Magnus, he had betrayed his imperium once, betrayed his legion once, and so any loyalty he had sworn to The Warmaster, and to Brutaxias’ small force, was completely arbitrary.</p>

  <p>Lesser members of The Sons of Magnus still cursed his name, a name Brutaxias had first heard many years ago: Azmodael.</p>

  <p>“What news from the chaos gods?” Brutaxias boomed.</p>

  <p>Azmodael looked up and let out a breathy cackle. “The omens are all the same,” he cawed. “War. Always war!” He scattered the portents and got to his feet.</p>

  <!-- The text continues -->

  <p>“I will not fail,” Brutaxias said. “We will not fail!”</p>

  <p>“The gods of Chaos do not fail,” Azmodael retorted. “And we are their playthings… Their schemes, and our places in them are not for us to know. Now, run along, pup of Abaddon, you have a war to win.” Azmodael let out a guttural chuckle.</p>

  <p>Brutaxias turned on his heel and marched towards his army. He would have to convene with the other force commanders soon, and a gathering of Chaos warlords was never a dull affair. He hoped his bodyguards were prepared…</p>
